# Webscrap
This project we are doing in python by using python libraries for scrapping. I have used Jupyter to run this project.
web scraper is a process of extracting specific data. Unlike web crawling, a web scraper searches for specific information on specific websites or pages.
So here you can use any website which is public.
The libraries which we need for this project are:-
pip install bs4
pip install requests
pip install html5lib
pip install urllib3
